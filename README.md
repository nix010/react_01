## How to run the project
**Note: For the sake of simplicity. I did backend and frontend in this same project folder !**

backend contains of:
/server

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the libs (I used `yarn`)

frontend contains of the rest of the files.

/frontend

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the libs (I used `yarn`)

### For Backend express

`cd server && node app.js`

The data will be seeded each start up. Navigate to `localhost:3001/chart` to see the data

### For Frontend react

`cd frontend && yarn start`

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app
