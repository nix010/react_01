## How to run the project
**Note: For the sake of simplicity. I did backend and frontend in this same project folder !**

backend contains of:

/server

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the libs (I used `yarn`)

frontend contains of the rest of the files.

/frontend

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the libs (I used `yarn`)

### For Backend express

`cd server && node app.js`


### For Frontend react

`cd frontend && yarn start`

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app
